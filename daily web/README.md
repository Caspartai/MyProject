# Individual Project Presentation

When you wake up every morning, whether you need to go to work or school.
You will pay attention to some daily related things.
Maybe they are in different mobile apps or websites, and you need to open different mobile apps or websites.
Maybe you have too many mobile apps on your phone, or you forgot the URL of the web page you need to go to.
Now you can view the things you need in one web page at a time.

# Introduction

There are some sections for different daily useful information.
Let me to introduce each section!

- Navbar
  It will help you to find the daily information you need quickly.
  And it use the scrollspy so when you scroll to the position of the specific target,
  there will have a special effect to show the section in the navbar.
  You also can click the button about the daily information you want to know,
  The button will link to the corresponding section and quickly go to that section。
- Clock
  The most important information that you must want to know will show clearly here.
  You can know what day of the week today
  and what the hour, minute, and second now is.
  This will remind you that maybe you should go out！
- Weather
  If you want to go out, you must face the weather in your city.
  So you need to get to know it, and decide different ways of travel and what to bring based on this.
  When you allow the browers to get your location,
  It will automatically display the current weather icon, temperature, general weather conditions and the name of the area in your area.
- Useful Tools
  You want know some information in other website,
  but sometimes you may forget the url or you don't want to enter very long url.
  There will have the icon and you can click to quickly go to the website.
- If you think of something and want to write it down, this will generate an email and send it to yourself.

#The features that you wanted to implement but you don’t have enough time to do so.

- The weather section add the future weather forecast,but it need to use different api link and that need use the Unix time,but I am confused about that.
- Sign up and Sign In Section is refer to online material,so there is still something difficult to me to completely understand that,if I can already understand that,I will make more changes to that section and add some useful funcion(e.g.add a alert to remind me to enter the correct format of the input,add a AddEventListener to get the value of input and send it to the index page.).
